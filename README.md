# Snakes and Ladders
Snakes and Ladders is an ancient Indian board game regarded today as a worldwide classic.

This is a multiplayer version (1-4 players) developed using HTML and CSS **without any JavaScript**. It is based on the idea of using radio-buttons, and labels to activate the radios, making the pieces move only using CSS positioning.
